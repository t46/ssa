Drawing on data from the World Values Survey Wave 7 (2017-2022), we employ structural equation modeling to examine how technological attitudes shape social relationships and institutional trust. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on technological determinism and social capital theory, offering insights into how digital technology adoption influences social trust in contemporary American society.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nIn an increasingly digitalized world, understanding the relationship between technological attitudes and social trust has become crucial for comprehending modern social dynamics. This research builds upon Putnam's seminal work on social capital decline while incorporating contemporary perspectives on technology-mediated social connections. We specifically examine how attitudes toward science and technology influence social trust levels, considering the mediating role of educational attainment and digital technology exposure.\n\n\\section{Theoretical Framework}\nOur theoretical framework integrates two major perspectives:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Technological determinism theory, which posits that technological development shapes social and cultural changes\n    \\item Social capital theory, particularly focusing on how digital technologies influence trust networks and social connections\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Research Hypothesis}\nThe primary hypothesis guiding this research is:\n\\begin{quote}\nH1: Individuals with more positive attitudes toward science and technology will demonstrate higher levels of generalized social trust, mediated by their level of digital technology adoption and educational attainment.\n\\end{quote}\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Data}\nWe utilize data from the World Values Survey Wave 7 (2017-2022), focusing on the United States sample. The analysis incorporates appropriate population weights (W\\_WEIGHT) to ensure representativeness.\n\n\\subsection{Variables}\n\\subsubsection{Dependent Variables}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Social trust indicators (Q60, Q58)\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection{Independent Variables}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Science attitudes (Q158)\n    \\item Technology adoption (Q44)\n    \\item Internet usage (internetusers)\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection{Control Variables}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Demographic factors (Q262, Q260)\n    \\item Socioeconomic status (Q288R)\n    \\item Geographic location (H\\_URBRURAL)\n    \\item Political orientation (Q94R)\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Analytical Approach}\nThe study employs structural equation modeling (SEM) to test direct and indirect effects, utilizing bootstrapped confidence intervals for mediation analysis. Multiple group analysis examines potential variations across age cohorts.\n\n\\section{Results}\n[Note: This section would typically contain detailed statistical results, which were not provided in the analysis output. The section should be populated with actual findings once the analysis is completed.]\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThe relationship between technological attitudes and social trust represents a critical area of investigation in contemporary society. Our research framework provides a structured approach to understanding these dynamics, though complete analysis results are pending.\n\n\\section{Limitations and Future Research}\nSeveral limitations should be noted:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Cross-sectional nature of the data\n    \\item Potential regional variations within the United States\n    \\item Self-reported measures of technology adoption\n\\end{itemize}\n\nFuture research should consider longitudinal studies to better understand causal relationships and incorporate additional measures of digital technology engagement.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nThis research framework provides a foundation for understanding the complex relationship between technological attitudes and social trust in modern American society. Complete analysis results will offer valuable insights for policymakers and researchers interested in the social implications of technological advancement.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{apalike}\n\\bibliography{references}\n\n\\end{document}\n
