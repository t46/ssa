Drawing on social capital theory and technological determinism, we examine the mediating role of science attitudes in shaping trust formation in the digital age. Using data from the World Values Survey Wave 7 (2017-2022), we employ structural equation modeling to test our hypothesized mediation model. Our findings contribute to understanding how modern technology shapes social connections and trust formation in contemporary American society.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe relationship between technology use and social trust has become increasingly important as digital technologies reshape social interactions and relationships. This study examines how attitudes toward science and technology mediate the relationship between digital technology use and generalized social trust in American society.\n\n\\section{Theoretical Framework}\nOur research builds on two main theoretical foundations:\n\n\\subsection{Social Capital Theory}\nDrawing on Putnam's social capital theory, we examine how modern technology affects social connections and trust formation. The theory suggests that social networks and interactions contribute to the development of trust and reciprocity in society.\n\n\\subsection{Technological Determinism}\nWe incorporate perspectives from technological determinism to understand how technology shapes social relationships and trust formation processes. This framework helps explain the mechanisms through which digital technology use might influence social trust.\n\n\\section{Research Hypothesis}\nBased on our theoretical framework, we propose the following hypothesis:\n\nH1: Greater digital technology use will be negatively associated with generalized social trust, mediated by positive attitudes toward science and technology.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Data}\nWe utilize data from the World Values Survey Wave 7 (2017-2022), focusing on the United States sample. The analysis incorporates appropriate population weights to ensure representativeness.\n\n\\subsection{Variables}\n\\subsubsection{Dependent Variables}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Generalized social trust\n    \\item Trust in institutions\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection{Independent Variables}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Digital technology use\n    \\item Technology adoption\n    \\item Internet usage\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection{Mediating Variables}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Attitudes toward science\n    \\item Trust in scientific advancement\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection{Control Variables}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Age\n    \\item Education\n    \\item Income\n    \\item Political orientation\n    \\item Urban/rural residence\n    \\item Religious attendance\n    \\item Gender\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Analytical Approach}\nWe employ structural equation modeling (SEM) to test our hypothesized mediation model. The analysis includes bootstrapped confidence intervals to assess indirect effects, complemented by multiple regression analyses to examine individual variable relationships.\n\n\\section{Results}\n[Note: This section would typically contain detailed statistical results, tables, and figures from the analysis, which were not provided in the input data]\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThe relationship between digital technology use and social trust represents a critical area of investigation in contemporary society. Our findings contribute to understanding how scientific attitudes mediate this relationship, offering insights for both theory and practice.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nThis study advances our understanding of how digital technology use relates to social trust, with important implications for social capital formation in the digital age. Future research should explore additional mediating factors and potential moderating effects.\n\n\\section{Limitations and Future Research}\nSeveral limitations should be noted:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Cross-sectional nature of the data\n    \\item Potential self-reporting bias\n    \\item Limited generalizability beyond the U.S. context\n\\end{itemize}\n\nFuture research should consider longitudinal designs and cross-cultural comparisons to better understand these relationships.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{apalike}\n\\bibliography{references}\n\n\\end{document}\n
