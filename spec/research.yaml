  title: 'Digital Technology and Social Trust: Examining the Role of Online Social
    Capital in American Society'
  objective: To investigate how Americans' engagement with digital technology and
    social media influences their levels of interpersonal and institutional trust,
    mediated by online social capital formation
  theoretical_background: Drawing on Putnam's social capital theory and its digital
    extension by Wellman et al., this study examines how online interactions reshape
    traditional trust formation mechanisms. The research builds on cybersocial transformation
    theory, which suggests that digital spaces create new forms of social connection
    and trust dynamics.
  hypotheses:
  - Greater engagement with digital technology and social media will be negatively
    associated with interpersonal trust levels, but this relationship will be moderated
    by the quality of online social capital

  analytical_approach: Structural equation modeling (SEM) to test direct and indirect
    effects, with bootstrapped confidence intervals for testing mediation. Multi-level
    modeling will account for regional clustering effects.
