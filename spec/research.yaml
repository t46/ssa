  title: 'Digital Technology and Social Trust: Examining the Role of Online Social
    Capital in American Society'
  objective: To investigate how Americans' engagement with digital technology and
    social media influences their levels of interpersonal and institutional trust,
    with particular attention to generational differences, digital capability levels,
    and the quality of online interactions
  theoretical_background: The study integrates Putnam's social capital theory with
    recent digital capability frameworks (Khin & Ho, 2018) and digital natives theory
    (Margaryan et al., 2010). It examines how digital transformation affects social
    trust formation through the lens of technological affordances and digital competencies,
    while considering the differential impacts across age groups and usage patterns
    identified in recent literature (Orben & Przybylski, 2019)
  hypotheses:
  - 'H1: Higher levels of digital capability (not just usage frequency) will be positively
    associated with online social capital formation'
  - 'H2: The relationship between digital technology use and interpersonal trust will
    be moderated by users'' digital competency levels'
  - 'H3: Quality of online interactions will have a stronger positive effect on trust
    formation than quantity of digital engagement'
  - 'H4: Age-related differences in digital capability will explain variance in trust
    outcomes beyond mere usage patterns'

  analytical_approach: 'Mixed-method approach combining: 1) Structural equation modeling
    (SEM) for testing direct and indirect effects, 2) Latent class analysis to identify
    distinct digital user profiles, 3) Hierarchical linear modeling for nested regional
    effects, 4) Qualitative analysis of online interaction patterns'
  literature_gaps:
  - Limited research on how digital capability (versus mere usage) affects trust formation
  - Lack of studies examining age-related differences in digital social capital formation
  - Need for more nuanced understanding of quality versus quantity in digital engagement
  - Insufficient investigation of platform-specific effects on trust outcomes
  - Limited integration of digital competency frameworks with social capital theory
