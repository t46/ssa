  title: 'The Role of Social Trust and Political Engagement in Shaping Democratic
    Values Among Americans: A Multi-Level Analysis'
  objective: To examine how social trust and political engagement interact to influence
    support for democratic values and institutions in the United States, while accounting
    for regional variations and causal mechanisms
  theoretical_background: This study integrates social capital theory (Putnam), political
    socialization theory, and recent work on mindfulness and psychological well-being
    (Brown & Ryan, 2003) to understand democratic value formation. The theoretical
    framework considers how conscious attention to civic life and deliberate political
    practice (drawing on Ericsson et al., 1993) may strengthen democratic orientations
    through enhanced social trust and engagement.
  hypotheses:
  - 'H1: Higher levels of social trust will be positively associated with stronger
    support for democratic values, with the effect being stronger in regions with
    higher civic participation rates'
  - 'H2: The relationship between social trust and democratic support will be sequentially
    mediated by political interest and civic participation'
  - 'H3: The positive effect of social trust on democratic support will be moderated
    by both the frequency and quality of political engagement'
  - 'H4: Individual-level effects of social trust on democratic support will vary
    by regional-level institutional trust'

  analytical_approach: Multi-level structural equation modeling (ML-SEM) with propensity
    score matching to address selection bias (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983). Bootstrap
    mediation analysis for testing sequential mediation effects. Regional clustering
    will be addressed through hierarchical linear modeling.
  literature_gaps:
  - Limited research on the quality versus quantity of political engagement
  - Lack of multi-level analysis incorporating regional variations in institutional
    trust
  - Need for causal pathway analysis in democratic value formation
  - Insufficient attention to the role of mindful civic attention in democratic engagement
  - Limited integration of psychological well-being frameworks in political socialization
