  title: 'Digital Technology and Social Trust: Examining the Role of Online Social
    Capital in American Society'
  objective: To investigate how Americans' engagement with digital technology and
    online social networks influences their levels of interpersonal and institutional
    trust, with particular attention to generational differences and digital capability
    levels
  theoretical_background: 'The study integrates three theoretical frameworks: (1)
    Putnam''s social capital theory and Wellman''s networked individualism, (2) digital
    capability theory from Khin & Ho (2018), which emphasizes the distinction between
    mere technology use and effective digital engagement, and (3) the digital natives
    paradigm critique by Margaryan et al. (2010), suggesting that technological competence
    varies independently of age. This integrated approach helps explain how digital
    engagement transforms traditional trust formation mechanisms while accounting
    for individual differences in digital capability.'
  hypotheses:
  - 'H1: The relationship between digital engagement and social trust will be moderated
    by individual digital capability levels'
  - 'H2: Online social capital formation will mediate the relationship between digital
    engagement and institutional trust more strongly for individuals with higher digital
    capability scores'
  - 'H3: The positive relationship between digital community participation and generalized
    trust will be stronger for activities involving reciprocal resource sharing versus
    passive consumption'
  - 'H4: Digital social support networks will have stronger effects on trust formation
    in urban versus rural environments'

  analytical_approach: Multi-level structural equation modeling (SEM) with nested
    data structure (individuals within platforms within regions). Latent class analysis
    to identify digital engagement patterns. Moderated mediation analysis using bootstrapped
    confidence intervals. Longitudinal component tracking trust evolution over 6-month
    period.
  literature_gaps:
  - Most digital technology studies focus on usage frequency rather than capability
    and effectiveness
  - Limited research on how digital capability moderates social capital formation
  - Lack of empirical work distinguishing between active and passive digital engagement
    effects on trust
  - Few studies examining platform-specific features' influence on trust formation
  - Need for more nuanced understanding of how geographic and demographic factors
    interact with digital social capital formation
