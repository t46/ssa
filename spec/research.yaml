  title: 'Digital Technology and Social Trust: Examining the Role of Science Attitudes
    as a Mediator in American Society'
  objective: To investigate how attitudes toward science and technology influence
    the relationship between digital technology use and generalized social trust among
    Americans
  theoretical_background: Drawing on social capital theory (Putnam) and technological
    determinism, this study explores how modern technology shapes social connections
    and trust formation. The research builds on cultivation theory to examine how
    exposure to digital technology and scientific worldviews shapes perceptions of
    social reality and trustworthiness of others.
  hypotheses:
  - Greater digital technology use will be negatively associated with generalized
    social trust, mediated by positive attitudes toward science and technology
  variables:
    dependent:
    - Q60
    - Q57
    independent:
    - Q44
    - Q44
    - Q3
    controls:
    - Q262
    - Q260
    - Q275A
    - Q288R
    - H_URBRURAL
    - Q98R
    - Q171
    mediators:
    - Q158
    - Q160
  analytical_approach: Structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypothesized
    mediation model, with bootstrapped confidence intervals to assess indirect effects.
    Multiple regression analyses will be used to examine individual variable relationships.
