  title: 'Digital Technology Adoption and Social Trust: Examining the Role of Science
    Attitudes in Modern American Society'
  objective: To investigate how attitudes toward science and technology influence
    social trust levels among Americans, considering the mediating role of educational
    attainment and exposure to digital technologies
  theoretical_background: Drawing on technological determinism theory and social capital
    theory, this study examines how technological attitudes shape social relationships
    and institutional trust. The research builds on Putnam's theory of social capital
    decline in the digital age, while incorporating more recent perspectives on how
    technology can create new forms of social connection and trust networks.
  hypotheses:
  - Individuals with more positive attitudes toward science and technology will demonstrate
    higher levels of generalized social trust, mediated by their level of digital
    technology adoption and educational attainment

  analytical_approach: Structural equation modeling (SEM) to test direct and indirect
    effects, with bootstrapped confidence intervals for testing mediation. Multiple
    group analysis will be conducted to examine whether relationships differ across
    age cohorts.
