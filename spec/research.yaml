  title: 'The Political Polarization of Trust: How Political Ideology Shapes Institutional
    and Interpersonal Trust in Contemporary America'
  objective: To examine how political ideology (liberal vs. conservative) influences
    patterns of trust in government institutions, media, and interpersonal relationships
    among Americans
  theoretical_background: Drawing on social capital theory (Putnam, 2000) and political
    psychology literature, this study explores how increasing political polarization
    affects fundamental trust relationships. Trust is essential for democratic functioning,
    yet partisan sorting may create distinct trust ecosystems.
  hypotheses:
  - 'H1: Conservative Americans will show higher trust in traditional institutions
    (military, police) while liberal Americans will show higher trust in scientific
    and educational institutions'
  - 'H2: Political ideology will moderate the relationship between media consumption
    patterns and institutional trust'
  - 'H3: Interpersonal trust will be negatively associated with perceived political
    polarization, regardless of individual ideology'

  title: 'Economic Insecurity and Social Values: How Financial Stress Shapes Americans''
    Attitudes Toward Immigration and Social Welfare'
  objective: To investigate how individual economic insecurity influences attitudes
    toward immigration policy and social welfare programs in the United States
  theoretical_background: Building on realistic group conflict theory and economic
    anxiety literature, this study examines how personal economic circumstances shape
    zero-sum thinking about resource distribution. Economic insecurity may activate
    in-group favoritism and resistance to policies perceived as benefiting out-groups.
  hypotheses:
  - 'H1: Higher economic insecurity will be associated with more restrictive attitudes
    toward immigration'
  - 'H2: The relationship between economic insecurity and welfare attitudes will be
    moderated by racial/ethnic identity'
  - 'H3: Economic insecurity will strengthen the correlation between nationalism and
    anti-immigration sentiment'

  title: 'Religion, Science, and Well-being: Exploring the Paradox of Faith and Happiness
    in Secular America'
  objective: To examine how religious beliefs and practices relate to subjective well-being
    and life satisfaction in an increasingly secular American society
  theoretical_background: While secularization theory predicts declining religious
    influence, research consistently shows positive associations between religiosity
    and well-being. This study explores mechanisms underlying this relationship and
    whether secular sources provide similar benefits.
  hypotheses:
  - 'H1: Religious attendance will show stronger positive associations with well-being
    than private religious beliefs'
  - 'H2: The religiosity-happiness relationship will be mediated by social support
    and sense of meaning'
  - 'H3: Trust in science will moderate the relationship between religiosity and well-being,
    with lower effects among those with high scientific trust'
