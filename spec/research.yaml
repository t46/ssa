  title: 'Digital Technology and Social Trust: Examining the Role of Online Social
    Capital in Shaping American Values'
  objective: To investigate how different patterns of digital technology engagement
    influence interpersonal trust and civic participation among American adults, while
    accounting for digital capability and technological competence
  theoretical_background: This study integrates Putnam's social capital theory with
    digital capability frameworks (Khin & Ho, 2018) and digital transformation literature.
    Recent research suggests that digital technologies create differentiated forms
    of social engagement depending on users' digital competencies and usage patterns
    (Margaryan et al., 2010). The framework acknowledges that digital spaces may both
    enhance and diminish social capital through distinct mechanisms, moving beyond
    simple positive/negative dichotomies to examine specific technological affordances
    and their social impacts.
  hypotheses:
  - 'H1: Higher levels of passive social media consumption will be negatively associated
    with generalized social trust'
  - 'H2: Active digital engagement (content creation, community moderation) will be
    positively associated with civic participation'
  - 'H3: Digital capability (technological competence and literacy) will moderate
    the relationship between online engagement and social trust'
  - 'H4: The negative relationship between passive social media use and trust will
    be stronger for users with lower participation in local organizations'

  analytical_approach: Multi-level structural equation modeling (SEM) with latent
    variable interactions to test moderation effects. Complementary qualitative analysis
    of digital interaction patterns through content analysis of participant activity
    logs. Time-lagged analysis to establish temporal precedence in key relationships.
  literature_gaps:
  - Previous studies have not adequately distinguished between passive and active
    forms of digital engagement
  - Limited research on how digital capability moderates social capital formation
    online
  - Need for more nuanced understanding of how different types of online activities
    affect social trust
  - Lack of integration between digital capability frameworks and social capital theory
  - Limited longitudinal evidence on causal relationships between digital engagement
    and social outcomes
