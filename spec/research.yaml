  title: 'Digital Technology and Social Trust: Examining the Mediating Role of Social
    Media Use in Americans'' Institutional Confidence'
  objective: To investigate how digital technology adoption and social media use patterns
    influence Americans' trust in major institutions, with particular attention to
    generational differences and digital capability levels
  theoretical_background: The study integrates social capital theory (Putnam), media
    system dependency theory, and digital capability framework (Khin & Ho, 2018).
    Recent literature suggests digital technologies have transformed social interactions
    and institutional relationships, particularly during crisis events like COVID-19
    (Ting et al., 2020). The research considers how digital literacy and technological
    capability moderate trust formation, moving beyond simple usage metrics to examine
    qualitative aspects of digital engagement.
  hypotheses:
  - 'H1: Higher levels of passive social media consumption will be negatively associated
    with institutional trust, while active engagement will show positive associations'
  - 'H2: Digital capability will moderate the relationship between social media use
    and institutional trust, with higher capability users showing more resilience
    to misinformation'
  - 'H3: The negative effects of social media exposure on institutional trust will
    be stronger for users with lower digital literacy scores'
  - 'H4: Generational differences in digital nativeness will moderate the relationship
    between digital technology use and institutional trust'

  analytical_approach: Multi-level structural equation modeling (SEM) with latent
    variables, incorporating interaction effects for moderation analysis. Longitudinal
    component to track trust changes over time. Platform-specific subgroup analyses
    to account for different social media environments.
  literature_gaps:
  - Limited research on how digital capability levels moderate social media effects
    on trust
  - Lack of studies examining platform-specific trust dynamics
  - Need for more nuanced understanding of active versus passive social media engagement
    effects
  - Gap in understanding how crisis events (like COVID-19) interact with digital technology
    use to shape institutional trust
  - Limited longitudinal research on trust resilience in digital contexts
